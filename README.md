# Django Unchained

Welcome to Django, a Python Web framework originally designed so that web professionals - namely those working in e-newsrooms - could "take applications from concept to completion" in as little time as possible and focus more on creating great content.

### Installfest

Before getting started with Django, you'll probably need to do the following.

`**brew install python/brew update python**`

Ensures that you have the latest version of Python on your computer (because Django is a Python Web framework). Upon **install** or **update**, you should have version 2.7.11.
